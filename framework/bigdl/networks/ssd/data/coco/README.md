#### Known issue
1. When building coco API to parse annotations, if Cython is not installed, ``` python setup.py build_ext --inplace ``` would failed with below error. So first install Cython.
     >     Traceback (most recent call last):
     >     File "setup.py", line 2, in <module>
     >     from Cython.Build import cythonize
     >     ImportError: No module named Cython.Build
  
 ```
 sudo pip install Cython
 ```
